= RAG

Welcome to the RAG assistant.

This project provides a local CLI/TUI assistant focused on machine learning, science fiction, and the cosmos.

RAG is open source under the Apache 2.0 license.

A couple of things are useful to know before you start.
For one, this repository uses AsciiDoc for the primary docs; here's an https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc quick reference].

We also keep optional artifacts (datasets, outputs) in repo-local directories.
See link:TRANSLATING.md[the translating document] for more information.

== How To Run the Assistant

You can run the CLI or TUI directly after installing dependencies.
If you run the following you _may_ actually get a working CLI, TUI, and tests:

----
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
$ pip install -e ".[test,dev]"
$ rag --help
$ rag-tui --help
$ .venv313/bin/python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
----

You can run just one of the supported entry points (CLI, TUI, or data collector).
Use one of the following commands:

To run the CLI:

----
$ rag
----

To run the TUI:

----
$ rag-tui
----

To run the data collector:

----
$ rag-collect
----

== Signaling an Issue

Before signaling an issue, please check that there isn't already a similar one in the bug tracking system.

Also, if this issue has been spotted in the CLI/TUI, please cross-check that it is still present with the current dependency set.
The issue may have already been corrected, but the changes have not been deployed yet.
